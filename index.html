<h1>TeleHealth Connect Africa</h1>
<body>
    <P>Access to healthcare services in many parts of Africa is limited, particularly in rural and remote areas. People often have to travel long distances to reach healthcare facilities, which can be both costly and time-consuming. Additionally, there is a shortage of healthcare professionals in many regions. This lack of accessibility to healthcare services leads to delayed diagnoses and treatment, resulting in poorer health outcomes.

    <p>Solution:
        "TeleHealth Connect Africa" is a telehealth platform designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers, making healthcare more accessible and affordable across the African continent.</p>
